- Using pivot tables found a lot of nan values in the ratings column, various with device in the size column and null values in the size column
- Grouped the ratings for ease of use as the data would be inaccurate
- Analyzed the data by calculating metrics like averages, percentages

Data visualization:
- In Tableau, I created charts and graphs to visualize the data, spot trends and identify patterns.

# Results:
1. Based on the analysis we have discovered that the most popular category is the Family category with 1826 apps, accounting for 19% of all apps and the average rating is 4.2 out of 5 indicating that it's a successful category.
2. With over 5000 apps receiving above 4-5 rating, it shows that the everyone content rating is the most favourable rating. It shows that a large number of apps cater to all ages.
3. The massive gap in download rates, with free applications getting 92.2% of downloads compared to paid apps getting 7.8%. This might suggest that users are likely to try free apps more which may or not eventually lead them to decide whether they want to get a premium version or ad-free version of the app.
