# Bank-Marketing-Database
# TASK:
I have supplied with a csv file called "bank_marketing.csv", which I will need to clean, reformat, and split, in order to save separate files based on the tables you will create.

# Actions:
- Imported the source csv file into Pandas dataframe for analysis and manipulation
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values, fixing formatting errors, standardizing column names
- Lastly, I will write the SQL code that the bank can execute to create the tables and populate with the data from the csv files. As the bank are quite strict about their security, I'll save SQL files as multiline string variables that they can then use to create the database on their end.

# Results:
- Generated 3 separate normalized CSVs without data quality issues
- Loaded the CSVs into PostgreSQL tables for the new system
